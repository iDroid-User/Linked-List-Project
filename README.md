# Linked-List-Project
A CSCI 2 assignment

This algorithm counts the frequency of letters in a text file fed to it. The data structure of choice to count letters was the **singly linked list**.

A list of restrictions followed:
  1. Use of arrays in any shape or form are not allowed.
  2. Use of vectors or any other list utilities are not allowed.
  3. You may not copy linked list implementations from other students or the internet.  Use your notes from class as a reference.
  4. You may NOT initialize the list first with 26 nodes (A to Z).  Instead, your class must be designed so that nodes are added to the list dynamically as they are read from the input file.

The LetterNode class will be used to store each letter as it is encountered in the file.
